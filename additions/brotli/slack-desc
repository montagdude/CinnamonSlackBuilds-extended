brotli: brotli (lossless compression format)
brotli:
brotli: Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that
brotli: compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
brotli: algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
brotli: compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
brotli: general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
brotli: deflate but offers more dense compression.
