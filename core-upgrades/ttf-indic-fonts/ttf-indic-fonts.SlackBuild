# I'm very interested in making this a better package, but have a
# long way to go in understanding how all of this works.  I know
# that at least some of the Wikipedia articles I read are filled
# in better now, but...
#
# For example, the hints files in the debian directory (where most
# of these fonts were found) -- what do they do?  And where do they
# go?  Also, some of the nicer looking fonts do not seem to be the
# defaults (perhaps also due to the lack of "hints").
#
# Hopefully this will at least provide a useful start for now.
#
# Have fun :-)
