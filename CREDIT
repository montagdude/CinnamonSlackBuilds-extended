1. All SlackBuilds in core-additions were adapted from the Slackware64-current
   source tree. Credit for these goes to Patrick Volkerding and the rest of
   the Slackware development team.
2. All SlackBuilds in csb were adapted from the CinnamonSlackBuilds project.
   Credit for these goes to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo and other contributors.
3. SlackBuilds in the additions directory were generally created from scratch,
   but in some cases portions of them were adapted from elsewhere (e.g.,
   SlackBuilds.org). Credit for these is given in the SlackBuild scripts
   themselves.

All SlackBuild scripts adapted from others retain their original copyright
notices and license.
